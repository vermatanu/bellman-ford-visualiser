            <h2>Shortest Paths</h2>
            <div class="paragraph">
                <p>In many applications one wants to obtain the shortest path from a to b.
                    Depending on the context, the length of the path does not necessarily have to be the length in meter:
                    One can as well look at the cost of a path – both if we have to pay for using it – or if we receive
                    some.</p>
                <p><strong>In general we speak of cost</strong>.
                    Therefore one assigns cost to each part of the path – also called "edge".</p>
                <p>Dijkstra's Algorithm computes shortest – or cheapest paths, if all cost are positive numbers.
                    However, if one allows negative numbers, the algorithm will fail.</p>
                <p>The Bellman-Ford Algorithm by contrast can also deal with negative cost.</p>
                <p>These can for example occur when a taxi driver receives more money for a tour than he spends on fuel. If
                    he does not transport somebody, his cost are positive.</p>
            </div>
            <h2>Idea of the Algorithm</h2>
            <div class="images">
                <img src="bfa2.png" alt="edge before update"> <p>This edge is a short-cut and can taverse the node in 21.</p>
                <img src="bfa3.png" alt="edge before update"> <p>Therefore the original cost is replaced by the minimum one i.e. 21.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph">
                <p>The Bellman-Ford Algorithm computes the <strong>cost</strong> of the cheapest paths from a starting node
                    to all other nodes in the graph.</p>
                <p>The algorithm proceeds in an interactive manner, by beginning with the highest estimate of the cost and then
                    improving it until the cminimum value is found.</p>
                <p>The first estimate is:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li> a. <strong>The starting node has cost 0</strong>, as his distance to itself is obviously 0.
                    </li><br>
                    <li> b. <strong>All other node have cost infinity</strong>, which is the worst estimate possible.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>Afterwards, the algorithm checks every edge for the following condition: <strong>Are the cost of the
                        source of the edge plus the cost for using the edge smaller than the cost of the edge's
                        target?</strong></p>
                <p>If this is the case, we have found a <strong>short-cut</strong>: It is more profitable to use the edge
                    which was just checked, than using the path used so far.
                    Therefore the cost of the edge's target get updated: They are set to the cost of the source plus the
                    cost for using the edge (compare example on the right).</p>
                <p>Looking at all edges of the graph and updating the cost of the nodes.
                    Unfortunately, it is not sufficient to look at all edges only once.
                    After the first phase, the cost of all nodes for which the shortest path only uses one edge have been
                    calculated correctly. After two phases all paths that use at most two edges have been computed
                    correctly, and so on.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="images"> <img src="bfa4.png" alt="graph with weights"> </div> 
           <div class="paragraph">
            <p>How many phases ware necessary? To answer this question, the observation that <strong>a shortest path has
                to use less edges than there are nodes in the graph.</strong>
            Thus, we need at most one phase less than the number of nodes in the graph. A shortest path that uses
            more edges than the number of nodes would visit some node twice and thus build a circle.</p>
           </div>
            <h2>Construction of the shortest path</h2>
            <div class="paragraph">
                <p>Each time when updating the cost of some node, the algorithm saves the edge that was used for the update
                    as the <strong>predecessor</strong> of the node.</p>
                <p>At the end of the algorithm, the shortest path to each node can be constructed by going backwards using
                    the predecessor edges until the starting node is reached.</p>
